                <h1>Simulations Week</h1>

        <h1>Simulations Week is an annual week-long simulation event for youth ages 12-18.</h1>
        <p>It’s also one of the projects I’ve been most passionate about during my years of doing graphic design work. After attending the event as a participant for the previous five years, I was invited to re-design the event’s branding as well as create
            an online presence for it.</p>
        <p>Project Duties: (all completed within a month and a half)</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Create event logo</li>
            <li>Design website</li>
            <li>Make themed headers for the event sign-up page</li>
            <li>Create illustrated t-shirt that featured busts of the adult mentors</li>
            <li>Create themed Facebook Page</li>
            <li>Generate weekly content for Social Media</li>
            <li>Create various signs, propaganda flyers, and pamphlets for use during the event.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Logo Design:</h3>
        <p>I designed a website whose primary design was to get participants excited for the year’s theme of “dystopian political warfare with a steampunk twist.”</p>
        <h3>Facebook Page:</h3>
        <p>I made a Facebook page for the company with themed header and profile images, then began to generate post content such as:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>A set of square hype images for social media to be released once a week</li>
            <li>Youth testimonial videos of previous participants. These videos were released right before the early-bird registration deadline to let potential participants see old friends encouraging them to sign up.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Reflecting back on this project 3 years later, I’m very proud of the large amount of content I was able to create in a small amount of time. One thing I would change however is my design of the event logo, which in hindsight was difficult to read.
            I’ve taken the liberty of re-designing the logo while following my current logo design process, and the result is a new design that still matches the event’s branding while being much more readable, functional, and scalable.</p>
        <img src="/images/sim_week_2.png" alt="Graphics created for Facebook">
        <p>This project allowed me to be a one-man show in charge of all the event’s design needs, expanding my ability to handle all kinds of company design duties. </p>
